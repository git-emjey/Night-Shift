# Night Shift

**Night Shift** is a narrative-driven psychological horror game set during a late-night convenience store shift.

## Story

You play as a night shift worker in a quiet store, expecting nothing more than another uneventful shift.  
As the night progresses, subtle details begin to feel *off* — locked doors, strange discoveries, and lingering silence.

What starts as routine slowly unfolds into something deeply unsettling.
